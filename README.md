Purpose:
I am an Undergraduate Research Assistant in a lab called the Lim Lab, located in the Yale School of Medicine. Our lab conducts research on a neurodegenerative disease called Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type-1 (SCA1), a disease that affects motor coordination and speech and is characterized by the neurodegeneration of the cerebellum. Our most recent published paper lays out some evidence of the role of the cortex in this neurodegeneration and pathology as well, which is novel to the SCA1 field.

Therefore, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we generated a gene list for the cortex and the cerebellum. These gene lists were analyzed and compared through Python, Pandas, and visualized through Matplotlib in the figures provided in the repository. They showcase the similarities and differences in biological processes and molecular functions throughout disease progression, which allows researchers to better focus their research on important pathology that could be occurring and potential pathways that are relevant enough to investigate.
